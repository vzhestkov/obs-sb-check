-- Bump version: 9.24.16 → 9.24.17
-  
-  This version includes fixes for:
-  
-  * Fix booting GRUB submenu entries with hybrid images (linux/linuxefi)
-    
-    Variables assigned with "set" are not visible in submenus for some reason.
-    Export $linux and $initrd, so that they also work in submenu entries.
-    
-    Fixes bsc#1192523

-- Don't exit the script on deprecated function use (bsc#1196644)
-  
-  The "exit 0" there stops processing of the calling script with a success exit
-  code, which leads to incomplete and broken images.

-- Bump version: 9.24.15 → 9.24.16
-  
-  This version upgrade includes several fixes:
-  
-  * Fixed regression in compression detection
-    
-    The change from 282529de8f612dee32d54ee868c2365dcd829220
-    Introduced a bad regression. The assumption was made that the
-    xz tool could be used to detect if a file is compressed or not.
-    However, this requires the file to be locally present. In the
-    scope of the method call is_compressed() and within a remote
-    deployment e.g PXE this is not the case. Therefore the former
-    way to "detect" the compression according to the .xz postfix
-    of the source filename was restored. In addition the function
-    name was changed to is_xz_compressed() because that's what the
-    method can do and not more. This Fixes #2015
-    
-    Fixes a regression in the scope of bsc#1192975 (#c16)
-    
-  * index.rst: Change title (bsc#1189294#c2)
-    
-  * 'KIWI NG 9: KIWI NG Documentation' -> 'Building Linux System Appliances with KIWI Next Generation (KIWI NG <VERSION>)
-  * suggested in bsc#1189294#c2 for more clarity
-  * change has been discussed with and approved by main author (Marcus S.)
-    
-  * Care for different snapper template locations
-    
-    snapper recently changed their config template location
-    from etc/ to usr/. This commit handles the two locations
-    and Fixes bsc#1192940
-    
-  * Do not force dracut into a compression setting
-    
-    So far we called dracut with --xz which forces the initrd
-    to be xz compressed. There are other compression formats
-    used by the distributions and they might differe from xz.
-    The selection for a compression tool is done by a dist
-    configuration in dracut.conf.d which is provided by the
-    distributions as they see fit. For us this means not
-    forcing dracut into a specific compression setting allows
-    to make use of the distro provided setting and also
-    allows to change/override this setting by an overlay
-    file. This Fixes bsc#1192975

-- Bump version: 9.23.20 → 9.24.2
-  
-  This version upgrade includes several fixes:
-  
-  * Fixed secure boot fallback setup
-    
-    Make sure MokManager gets copied. The name and location of
-    the mok manager is distribution specific in the same way as
-    the shim loader. Thus we need to apply a similar concept
-    for looking it up. This Fixes bsc#1187515
-    
-  * Allow creation of LUKS system with empty key
-    
-    To support cloud platforms better we should allow the
-    creation of an initial(insecure) LUKS encrypted image
-    with an empty passphrase/keyfile. This Fixes
-    bsc#1187461 and bsc#1187460
-    
-  * Delete obsolete ddb.adapterType patching
-    
-    When building a vmdk image with pvscsi as adapter type, kiwi
-    implicitly changed the adapter_type from pvscsi to lsilogic
-    because qemu only knows lsilogic. At the end kiwi patched
-    the adapter type in the descriptor of the vmdk header back
-    to pvscsi. That patching seems to be wrong according to
-    information from users and VMware support. This commit
-    deletes the descriptor patching and only leaves the pvscsi
-    setting in the guest configuration(vmx).
-    This Fixes bsc#1180539 and Fixes #1847
-    
-  * Make dracut version check more robust
-    
-    The check_dracut_module_versions_compatible_to_kiwi() runtime
-    check calls the package manager from the host and reads the
-    package database from the image root. Doing this requires
-    the package database in the image to be compatible with the
-    package manager on the host. However this cannot be guarenteed
-    and it is more robust to chroot into the image root and call
-    the package manager from there. However, this change also comes
-    with the cost that it's required to have a package manager
-    available in the image root tree. Therefore along with the
-    chroot based call, eventual exceptions from the call are now
-    catched and leads to a debug message in the log file but will
-    not lead the runtime check to fail. I consider the cases
-    without a package database inside of the image to be less
-    critical than the incompatibility issue between the host
-    tooling and the package database in the image.
-    This Fixes bsc#1185937
-    
-  * Fixed setup of repository architecture
-    
-    Unfortunately the architecture reported by uname is not
-    necessarily the same name as used in the repository metadata.
-    Therefore it was not a good idea to set the architecture
-    and manage the name via a mapping table. It also has turned
-    out that repo arch names are distro specific which causes
-    more complexity on an eventual mapping table. In the end
-    this commit changes the way how the repository architecture
-    is setup in a way that we only set the architecture if
-    a name was explicitly specified such that the user keeps
-    full control over it without any mapping magic included
-    This Fixes bsc#1185287
-    
-  * Do not apply default subcommand for derivate containers
-    
-    This commit does not apply the default subcommand for derivate
-    containers. Fixes bsc#1184823
-    
-  * Added openssl to the core requires
-    
-    openssl is used in kiwi to construct a password hash
-    if the plaintext password feature for user settings
-    is used. This Fixes bsc#1184128
