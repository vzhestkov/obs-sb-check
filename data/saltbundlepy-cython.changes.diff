-- update to 0.29.30:
-  * Avoid acquiring the GIL at the end of nogil functions. This change
-    was backported in order to avoid generating wrong C code that
-    would trigger C compiler warnings with tracing support enabled. 
-  * Function definitions in finally: clauses were not correctly generated.
-  * A case where C-API functions could be called with a live exception
-    set was fixed.
-  * Cython now correctly generates Python methods for both the provided
-    regular and reversed special numeric methods of extension types.
-  * The C union type in pure Python mode mishandled some field names.

-- update to 0.29.28:
-  * Due to backwards incompatible changes in CPython 3.11a4, the feature flags
-    ``CYTHON_FAST_THREAD_STATE`` and ``CYTHON_USE_EXC_INFO_STACK`` are now disabled
-    in Python 3.11 and later.  They are enabled again in Cython 3.0.
-    Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue #4610)
-  * A C compiler warning in older PyPy versions was resolved.
-    Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue #4236)

-- Make the running the test suite conditional (default
-  off). Seven hours of running it is just too much.

-- update to 0.29.27:
-  * The ``cythonize`` command has a new option ``-M`` to generate ``.dep`` dependency
-    files for the compilation unit.  This can be used by external build tools to track
-    these dependencies.
-  * Calls to ``range()`` with more than three arguments did not fail.
-  * Some C compiler warnings about missing type struct initialisers in Py3.10 were resolved.
-  * Cython no longer warns about using OpenMP 3.0 features since they are now
-    considered generally available.

-- update to 0.29.26:
-  * An incompatibility with CPython 3.11.0a3 was resolved.
-  * The ``in`` operator failed on literal lists with starred
-    expressions.
-  * A C compiler warning in PyPy about a missing struct field
-    initialisation was resolved.

-- update to 0.29.25:
-  * Several incompatibilities with CPython 3.11 were resolved.
-  * Some C compiler warnings were resolved.
-  * C++ ``std::move()`` should only be used automatically in MSVC versions that support it.
-  * The ``Py_hash_t`` type failed to accept arbitrary "index" values.
-  * Avoid copying unaligned 16-bit values since some platforms require them to be aligned.
-    Use memcpy() instead to let the C compiler decide how to do it.
-  * Cython crashed on invalid truthiness tests on C++ types without ``operator bool``.
-  * The declaration of ``PyUnicode_CompareWithASCIIString()`` in ``cpython.unicode`` was incorrect.
